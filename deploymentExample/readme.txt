This is an example about a system deployment what means that it's not recommended to be run without change a few things and check all the files before.
The vast majority of the script commands use sudo, but for security reasons it's not recommended to use it on a deployment environment. Take it into consideration!
It uses an ip as address, not a domain. If you want to use a domain you should change a few things.
The things that always are going to change are marked as in the following example: <ipAddress>. However, you should check all the instructions and files to check that it's going to work without errors.
Check all the readme.txt files available inside all the folders.
Now, you can go ahead the deployment folder.
